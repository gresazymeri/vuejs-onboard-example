# Introduction

This repository serves as an example for implementing a onboarding flow in a Vue.js web application. The onboarding process is designed to introduce new users to a product or service and guide them through the necessary steps to get started.

# Installation

To install and use the vuejs-onboard-example repository, follow these steps:

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (the Node.js package manager) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/) or through a package manager such as Homebrew (for macOS) or nvm (for Linux).

Clone the vuejs-onboard-example repository to your local machine using Git:

`git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/vuejs-onboard-example.git`

Navigate to the project directory:


`cd vuejs-onboard-example`

Install the dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:

`npm run serve`

This will compile and serve the application, and you should be able to view it in your web browser at http://localhost:8080.

That's it! You're now ready to start exploring the vuejs-onboard-example repository and using it as a reference for implementing an onboarding flow in your own Vue.js application.
